## Introduction:

As any wild mushroom forager knows, mushroom identification can often be difficult and time consuming. Currently, several apps exist to address this problem: most of them allow a user to upload a picture and then return a prediction of the mushroom's variety or edibility. Many of these apps are fairly accurate and can be useful tools for a mushroom forager.

Another feature these apps have in common is their reliance on internet. Since most neural networks use more computing power than a battery powered smart phone is capable of, the apps rely on external servers to process the data and return a prediction that the phone displays for the user. Since most mushroom foraging takes place in the woods, where cell service is often unreliable, current mushroom identification apps .

My objective is to create a convolutional neural network that will be light-weight enough to be operated on a smartphone, without the need for external servers.
